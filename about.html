          <h1>ODA Special Boarding School</h1>
          <p>
            ODA Boarding school is an institution where children live within
            premises while being given formal instruction. Students in the
            boarding school study and live during the school year with their
            fellow students. The concept of boarding school is an intensive form
            of education in which students live at school and visit their
            families only at summer. The history of boarding school goes back
            over hundreds of years. However in the past, boarding schools were
            exclusively joined by monasteries and royal families. But now
            boarding schools are becoming popular even in developing countries
            and have been used to increase the educational opportunities of
            marginalized and disadvantaged students as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            ODA Boarding school is opened at East Showa of Adama and Bishoftu
            town giving full package services besides providing with quality
            education. Adama Boarding school started in Adama town in February
            2014G.C/2006 E.C. Since then it has been developed to be a
            successful boarding school proving a first class education to
            students from across Oromia. Both schools have been working to
            assure quality of education since its establishment. The teachers
            are supporting the students even after school time without
            additional payment.
