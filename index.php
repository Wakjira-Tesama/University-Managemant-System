				<h1>ODA Special Boarding School </h1>
				<p>
					ODA Boarding school is an institution where children live within premises while being given formal instruction. Students in the boarding school study and live during the school year with their fellow students. The concept of boarding school is an intensive form of education in which students live at school and visit their families only at summer. The history of boarding school goes back over hundreds of years. However in the past, boarding schools were exclusively joined by monasteries and royal families. But now boarding schools are becoming popular even in developing countries and have been used to increase the educational opportunities of marginalized and disadvantaged students as well.
				<p>ODA Boarding school is opened at East Showa of Adama and Bishoftu town giving full package services besides providing with quality education.

				Adama Boarding school started in Adama town in February 2014G.C/2006 E.C. Since then it has been developed to be a successful boarding school proving a first class education to students from across Oromia. Both schools have been working to assure quality of education since its establishment. The teachers are supporting the students even after school time without additional payment.</p>
